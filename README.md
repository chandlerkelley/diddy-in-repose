#Diddy in Repose

##Overview

I created a CRUD app where users can help create a crowdsourced collection of
music videos where Diddy makes an appearance, but in no way contributes to the
song by rapping, singing, producing, or otherwise performing. There are many
example of this sort of video. I intend to collect them all. Users can submit
videos, then edit and delete the videos they submitted, or they can browse all
the videos submitted by all users. They can also browse just the videos submitted
by any single other user.
